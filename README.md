## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Router
- Fetch API

### What I learned

During this project, I gained valuable insights into several key React and web development concepts:

1. **Component State Management**

   - Learned about proper state lifting and prop passing between parent and child components
   - Gained experience with form state handling in separate components

2. **React Router Navigation**

   - Implemented dynamic routing with URL parameters for country details
   - Mastered the use of `useNavigate` hook for programmatic navigation

   ```javascript
   const navigate = useNavigate();
   // Using navigate(-1) for back functionality
   <button onClick={() => navigate(-1)}>‚Üê Back</button>;
   ```

3. **API Data Fetching Patterns**

   - Implemented efficient data fetching using SWR
   - Learned about handling dependent API calls (border countries)
   - Managed loading and error states for better UX

   ```javascript
   const { data: borderCountries } = useSWR(
     () =>
       borders?.length > 0
         ? `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/alpha?codes=${borders.join(',')}`
         : null,
     fetcher
   );
   ```

4. **Dark Mode Implementation**

   - Successfully implemented theme switching with Tailwind CSS
   - Learned about persisting user preferences using localStorage
   - Managed theme-related state across components

5. **Performance Optimization**

   - Implemented lazy loading for images
   - Created reusable components for better code organization

6. **Accessibility Considerations**
   - Added proper ARIA labels and roles
   - Ensured keyboard navigation works correctly
   - Maintained semantic HTML structure

These learnings have significantly improved my understanding of React best practices and modern web development patterns.
